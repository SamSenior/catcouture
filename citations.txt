1. The sections of code that incorporate the paginationÂ was inspired by the class exercise and tutorial videos made by DI teacher Mark.
The safePage and Safelimit checks on the router page could potentially be removed as we have error handling to catch errors before these checks occur but I thought
it would be good to leave it in as it provides another layer of protection for the app and means if error handling were to become unoperational,
the data could still be parsed and the app would still work.

I also used some of the tutorial videos made by DI instructor Lance as a guide.
